# Tenderly Node Extension Library

This library is a collection of Tenderly Node Extensions. It is used to extend the Tenderly Web3 Gateway (Node-as-a-Service) with additional functionality.

Node Extensions is a game-changing enhancement to our existing production node. It allows devs to create custom JSON-RPC method names and write custom JS/TS code snippets, which will be executed each time the method is called. It’s like having your very own sorcerer’s apprentice working behind the scenes! 🧙‍

## How to use
